# Ripple Trade client

## Overview
The Ripple Trade client is an open-source GUI for the Ripple network that facilitates the peer-to-peer exchange of any store of value. Itâ€™s the only platform where you can trade between stores of value spanning fiat, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and unusual assets like pre-1965 silver dimes.

[Ripple Labs](https://ripplelabs.com) is the core team behind the project. For more information on the Ripple protocol, please visit our [wiki](https://ripple.com/wiki/).

We would love to have folks contribute! Check out our bounties [here](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/ripple/bounties).

Ripple Trade is available at www.rippletrade.com, or you can download the desktop version at [download.ripple.com](download.ripple.com).

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Install Node.js, Grunt, Git and Python 2 if you haven't already.

Install bower by running `bower install --allow-root`.

Fork and clone the ripple-client repository and run `npm install`.

Create a new config.js file and copy/paste from config-example.js into the same directory, located under 'src/js'.

Likewise, create a new config.json file by copying config-example.json in the same directory, located under the repo root directory.

### Build

Run 'grunt' in your command line to build the client.

Your web client is in the 'build/bundle/web/' directory. Use 'index_debug.html' for development.

If you want to watch for changes and have the client rebuild for index_debug.html, run 'grunt watch' while you make changes.

A web server is needed to serve the built files. Please have a look at our ['Setting Up Local Environment' wiki post](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-client/wiki/Setting-Up-Local-Environment) for more information.

After the first successful build, create a ['ripple.txt'](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ripple.txt) file inside 'build/bundle/web/'. You can copy the contents for the file from [here](https://www.ripple.com/ripple.txt).
