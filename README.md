# Ripple Trade client

## Overview
The Ripple Trade client is an open-source GUI for the Ripple network that facilitates the peer-to-peer exchange of any store of value. Itâ€™s the only platform where you can trade between stores of value spanning fiat, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and unusual assets like pre-1965 silver dimes.

[Ripple Labs](https://ripplelabs.com) is the core team behind the project. For more information on the Ripple protocol, please visit our [wiki](https://ripple.com/wiki/).

Ripple Trade is available at www.rippletrade.com, or you can download the desktop version at [download.ripple.com](download.ripple.com).

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Install Node.js, Grunt, and Git if you haven't already.

Fork and clone the ripple-client repository and run 'npm install'.

Create a new config.js file and copy/paste from config-example.js into the same directory, located under 'src/js'.

Likewise, create a new config.json file by copying config-example.json in the same directory, located under the repo root directory.

### Build

Run 'grunt' in your command line to build the client.

Your web client is in the 'build/bundle/web/' directory. Use 'index_debug.html' for development.

If you want to watch for changes and have the client rebuild for index_debug.html, run 'grunt watch' while you make changes:

Please have a look at our ['Setting Up Local Environment' wiki post](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-client/wiki/Setting-Up-Local-Environment) for more information.
