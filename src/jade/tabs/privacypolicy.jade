    | applies to information we collect when you use our website (<a href="http://www.rippletrade.com">www.rippletrade.com</a>)
    | and the online services made available via our website (collectively,
    | “<strong>Ripple Trade</strong>”).  Ripple Trade allows you to interact directly with the decentralized

    | Wallet via Ripple Trade;
  p (2) a restricted storage component, which contains the information you provide about any recipient (such as the
    | Ripple name or Ripple public address of the recipient) when you send a balance via Ripple Trade; and
  p (3) an ID storage component, which includes contact and other identifiable information you provide about yourself
    | via Ripple Trade, including the email address you provide when first setting up a Ripple Wallet and any
    | information you submit for identity verification purposes.
